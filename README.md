Welcome to the **Fourier Transform Tutorial** repository, designed to help chemists understand the principles and applications of Fourier Transforms (FT) in NMR and IR spectroscopy. Using Python, this tutorial provides hands-on activities and guided notebooks that cover key FT concepts as applied to spectral data. Please visit this [link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09619) to find the corresponding manuscript.

This repository contains:
- Interactive activities and problem sets to explore FT concepts in spectroscopy.
- Sample FID (Free Induction Decay) data from a 2-butanone sample in CDCl₃, collected on a Varian 500 MHz NMR spectrometer.
- Solutions to all activities for self-assessment and guided learning.
